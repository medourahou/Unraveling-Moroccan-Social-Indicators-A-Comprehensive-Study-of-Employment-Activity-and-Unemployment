# Unraveling Moroccan Social Indicators: A Comprehensive Study of Employment Activity and Unemployment

Data analysis is one of the trend fields today for its efficiency to analyze some phenomena (company's revenues, social indicators,...).
This project aims to analyze some Moroccan social indicators: Employment, activity, and unemployment based on a dataset of the Moroccan High Commission for Planning (dataset details are in the file project_report.pdf). The process of analysis is done by applying Principal component analysis (PCA) which is an extremely powerful tool for synthesizing information, very useful when there is a large amount of quantitative data to process and interpret. 
This is done by using R studio and the PCA function of the FactoMineR package. Afterward, we made our implementation of PCA in Python and made a small comparison between the two functions. You can read the two reports PCA_documentation.pdf and project_in_R.R
